# Feature Manifest Differences
In the Actions tab the Manifestor Deep Diff action can be manually run to find any differences in the FeatureManifest.yaml file. The repository stores a snapshot of the page after running and it will always compare the latest version with the last snapshot.

Any differences found will be uploaded as issues assigned to a milestone for tracking purposes. Issues should be closed once the change was tested.

A .json with the differences will also be available as an artefact after the script finishes running.
The archive of differences can also be found: [here]([url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19h9LueDL9gUYSkxYBI6FT2ZhirD-7avK?usp=sharing))

# Tracking Feature Config testing outside of auto-created issues
Note: Do not create a tracking issue for experiments/rollouts where only filters were validated.

After a Feature was tested as a Feature Config or part of Experiment/Rollout validation, an issue should be logged for tracking purposes:
1. Create a new issue using the "Feature Tested" template.
2. Add a link to the QA JIRA ticket where the feature/experiment was tested.
3. Add the feature config name in the title and milestone section.

Once testing is finished:
1. Add the date when the Sign-off was sent.
2. Add labels with the tested Firefox Versions
3. Close the issue and select a QA status color in the Projects section

# Project Tracking board
All of the issues logged for every Feature Config can be found in the Project section along with the QA Status and tested versions.
